# Hypermode AssemblyScript Library

This repository contains the shared library used by Hypermode functions written in AssemblyScript.
It provides access to host functions of the Hypermode platform, as well as additional
AssemblyScript classes and helper functions for use with Hypermode functions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or higher installed. (Version 20 is recommended.)

If desired, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) to install
and select a specific version of Node.js. This is useful if you have multiple versions on your machine.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

### Compiling an example project

The [`examples`](./examples/) folder contains example projects that you can test with,
or use as starter templates for your own functions projects.
See the README file in each sample for further details.

### Publishing to Hypermode

_TBD_
